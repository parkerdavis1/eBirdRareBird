# [Alternate eBird Rare Bird Alert](https://rarebird.parkerdavis.dev/)

I created this full stack multi-page app using Sveltekit and TailwindCSS. For the design, I tried to stay as close to eBird's own styling while adding a few UX features I would like to see incorporated such as grouping sightings by species/location and adding a dark mode. I incorporated some of the more modern eBird design elements such as boldly colored top bars across the top, a filter bar and filter tags as well as incorporating fades and slide-in animations for details and filter modals.
